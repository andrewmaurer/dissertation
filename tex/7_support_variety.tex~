\chapter{Support Variety Theory}
\label{ch:support}

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:supp-motivation}

The finite-generation result of Chapter \ref{ch:finite-generation} opens the door to use the powerful machinery of algebraic geometry when studying cohomology of classical Lie superalgebras relative to an even subsuperalgebra.

In this chapter, the cohomology variety $\V_{(\g,\a)}(\CC)$ is defined, along with support varieties

$\V_{(\g,\a)}(M) \subseteq \V_{(\g,\a)}(\CC)$ for each module $M$. Natural mappings of cohomology rings yield natural mappings of cohomology varieties.

Conjectures are presented, and of particular interest is the elusive tensor-product-theorem, i.e., $\V_{(\g,\a)}(M \otimes N) = \V_{(\g,\a)}(M) \cap \V_{(\g,\a)}(N)$. The tensor product theorem has been established in several contexts in varying levels of generality. The proof always relies on concrete details, primarily through the use of explicit rank varieties. 

\section{Definition and Basic Properties}
\label{sec:def-sv}

Let $\g$ be a classical Lie superalgebra and $\a \leq \even{\g}$ a subsuperalgebra. The cohomology ring $\H^\bullet(\g,\a;\CC)$ is a graded-commutative ring, and as such the subring
\begin{equation} \label{eq:even-cohomology}
  \H^{ev}(\g,\a;\CC) = \bigoplus_{n \in \ZZ_{\geq 0}} \H^{2n}(\g,\a;\CC) \subseteq \H^\bullet(\g,\a;\CC)
\end{equation}
is a commutative, finitely-generated subring of $\H^\bullet(\g,\a;\CC)$, by Theorem [??]. This leads to the first definition of this chapter.


\begin{definition}
  Let $\g = \even{\g} \oplus \odd{\g}$ be a classical Lie superalgebra with $\a \leq \even{\g}$ an even subsuperalgebra. The \emph{cohomology variety of $\g$ relative to $\a$} is the spectrum of the even subring of Equation \ref{eq:even-cohomology}:
  \[
    \V_{(\g,\a)}(\CC) = \maxspec\left( \H^{ev}(\g,\a;\CC)\right)
  \]
\end{definition}

For each $\g$-module $M$, $\Ext_{(\g,\a)}(M,M)$ is a graded module for the cohomology ring $\H^\bullet(\g,\a;\CC) = \Ext_{(\g,\a)}^\bullet(\CC,\CC)$ via the tensor product or cup product, as in Section [??]. Of course, $\Ext_{(\g,\a)}^\bullet(M,M)$ is a graded module for the subring $\H^{ev}(\g,\a;\CC)$. This means the annihilator
\[
  \Ann_{\H^{ev}(\g,\a;\CC)}\left(\Ext_{(\g,\a)}^\bullet(M,M)\right) \trianglelefteq \H^{ev}(\g,\a;\CC)
\]
is a homogeneous ideal for the even-degree subring of the cohomology ring.

\begin{definition}
  Let $\g = \even{\g} \oplus \odd{\g}$ be a classical Lie superalgebra with $\a \leq \even{\g}$ an even subsuperalgebra. The \emph{relative support variety} of $M$ is the vanishing set of its annihilator. In other words,
  \[
    \V_{(\g,\a)}(M) = \Z\left( \Ann_{\H^{ev}(\g,\a;\CC)}\left(\Ext_{(\g,\a)}^\bullet(M,M)\right)\right) \subseteq \V_{(\g,\a)}(\CC)
  \]
\end{definition}

Immediately, we may rephrase common properties of modules in terms of support varieties.

\begin{proposition}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item For any $\g$-module $M$, $\V_{(\g,\a)}(M)$ is a closed, conical subvariety of $\V_{(\g,\a)}(\CC)$.
  \item For any $\g$-modules $M_1$ and $M_2$, $\V_{(\g,\a)}(M_1 \oplus M_2) = \V_{(\g,\a)}(M_1) \cup \V_{(\g,\a)}(M_2)$.
  \item Whenever $0 \to M_1 \to M_2 \to M_3 \to 0$ is a short exact sequence of $\g$-modules, and $\sigma \in \mathfrak{S}_3$ is a permutation of three letters, $\V_{(\g,\a)}(M_{\sigma(1)}) \subseteq \V_{(\g,\a)}(M_{\sigma(2)}) \cup \V_{(\g,\a)}(M_{\sigma(3)})$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\section{Natural Maps of Cohomology Varieties}
\label{sec:natural-maps}

In this section we exploit the realization of cohomology groups as $n$-fold extensions to see how relations between Lie superalgebras become morphisms of their associated support varieties.

Recall the realization
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ses-cohom}
  \H^n(\g,\a;\CC) = \{ 0 \to \CC \to E_1 \to \ldots \to E_n \to \CC \to 0 \mid \circledast \} / \sim
\end{equation}
where $\circledast$ is the condition that the sequence is exact as a sequence of $\g$-modules and splits on restriction to $\a$, and $\sim$ is an equivalence reaction obtained from the pre-equivalence relation of there existing morphisms between extensions.
\TODO{Structure}{Maybe this should go into the section on cohomology rings.}

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{relative subsuperalgebra} is a quadruple $(\b \leq \h, \a \leq \g)$. Here $\h \leq \g$ is a classical subsuperalgebras, in the sense that $\even{\h} \leq \even{\g}$ and $\odd{\h} \leq \odd{\g}$. Further, $\a$ is a subsuperalgebra of $\g$ and $\b$ is a subsuperalgebra of $\h$ which is also contained in $\a$. See Figure \ref{fig:relative-pair} for a pictographic definition.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \a \arrow[r,hook] & \g \\
    \b \arrow[u,hook] \arrow[r,hook] & \h \arrow[u,hook]
  \end{tikzcd}
  \caption{Relative subsuperalgebra}
  \label{fig:relative-pair}
\end{figure}




In the case that $\b \leq \h$ is a relative subsuperalgebra of the pair $\a \leq \g$, there is a natural restriction morphism of cohomology rings:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nat-cohom}
  \resmap: \H^\bullet(\g,\a;\CC) \to \H^\bullet(\h,\b;\CC)
\end{equation}
This yields a natural morphism of cohomology varieties
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nat-supp}
  \resmap^*: \V_{(\h,\b)}(\CC) \to \V_{(\g,\a)}(\CC).
\end{equation}

There are several special cases in which the morphism of Equation \ref{eq:nat-supp} is especially useful. By Theorem [??], $\H^\bullet(\g,\a;\CC)$ is an integral extension of a quotient of $\H^\bullet(\g,\even{\g};\CC)$ via the restriction morphism (which by [??] is the edge homomorphism of the spectral sequence). This means that the morphism of varieties
\[
  \resmap^* : \V_{(\g,\a)}(\CC) \to \V_{(\g,\even{\g})}(\CC)
\]
is a finite-to-one map. Further, by the results of Boe-Kujawa-Nakano \cite{BKN-1} the cohomology variety $\V_{(\g,\even{\g})}(\CC)$ may be realized as closed orbits
\[
  \V_{(\g,\even{\g})}(\CC) = \left\{ \even{G}.x \mid x \in \odd{\g} \text{ and } \even{G}.x \text{ is closed} \right\}.
\]
This proves to be an invaluable morphism, allowing us to realize elements of the support variety $\V_{(\g,\a)}(\CC)$ as closed orbits in the space $\V_{(\g,\even{\g})}(\CC)$.

\section{Rank Varieties}
\label{sec:rank-varieties}

While many common properties of support varieties follow from the general theory of modules for rings, one result that requires explicit, context-dependent computations is the proof of the elusive \emph{tensor product theorem}, stated below as a conjecture.

\begin{conjecture}[Tensor Product Theorem]
  \label{conj:tpt}
  Let $\g = \even{\g} \oplus \odd{\g}$ be a classical Lie superalgebra and $\a \leq \even{\g}$ an even subsuperalgebra. Let $M$ and $N$ be two $\g$-modules, then we may identify the support variety of their tensor product as follows:
  \[
    \V_{(\g,\a)}(M \otimes N) = \V_{(\g,\a)}(M) \cap \V_{(\g,\a)}(N).
  \]
\end{conjecture}

In many cases, the path to this theorem depends on the establishment of a rank variety description of the support variety $\V_{(\g,\a)}(M)$.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:rank-variety}
  Let $\g = \even{\g} \oplus \odd{\g}$ be a classical Lie superalgebra and $\a \leq \even{\g}$ an even subsuperalgebra. The \emph{rank variety} of $\g$ relative to $\a$ is the variety
  \[
    \V_{(\g,\even{\g})}^\#(M) = \left\{ \even{G}.x \mid x \in \odd{\g}, \even{G}.x \text{ is closed, and } M\res_{\left<x\right>}\text{ is not projective}  \right\} \cup \{0\}
  \]
  The study of the structure of $\left<x\right>$ was conducted in Example \ref{ex:q1} and the cohomology rings were identified in Example [??]. 
\end{definition}
