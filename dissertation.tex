\begin{abstract}  
The author establishes finite-generation of the cohomology ring of a classical Lie superalgebra relative to an even subsuperalgebra. A spectral sequence is constructed to provide conditions for when this relative cohomology ring is Cohen-Macaulay. With finite generation established, support varieties for modules are defined via the relative cohomology, which generalize those of \cite{BKN-1}.

%   This is the abstract, a brief summary of the contents of the thesis.  It
% is limited to 150 words in length for a master's thesis or 350 words for
% a doctoral dissertation.

% The abstract page(s) are not numbered and are not necessarily included
% in the bound copies.  Likewise, the signature page is not counted in
% page numbering because not all copies contain it.

% Throughout this sample thesis, {\bf please note
% that the layout obtained with \LaTeX\ is not meant to be a
% perfect duplicate of the Microsoft Word examples in the \emph{Graduate
% School Style Manual.}}  \LaTeX\ has additional typographic tools at its
% disposal, such as {\sc small capitals} and various subtle adjustments
% of spacing, which are used by the \LaTeX\ UGa style sheet in accordance
% with the standard practices of the book-printing industry.

% The index words at the bottom of the abstract should be chosen carefully,
% preferably with the help of one or two of your colleagues.
% They are the words by which people will find your thesis when searching
% the scientific literature.
% If you want to get credit for your ideas, be sure to choose a good set of
% index words so that people doing related work will know about yours.

\maketitle    % Creates title page, copyright page if any, and approval page.


% \chapter*{Dedication}

% The Dedication is optional, but if it is included, it should have
% a roman numeral page number but not be included in the table of
% contents.  To achieve that, we declare it as a \verb"\chapter*" in \LaTeX.


\pseudochapter{Acknowledgments}

The author would like to thank his advisor, Dr Daniel Nakano for much motivation and support, and Dr William Graham for helpful conversations involving spectral sequences and Lie algebra cohomology. This work was completed as a part of the author's dissertation at University of Georgia, and was partially supported by the Research and Training Group in Algebraic Geometry, Algebra and Number Theory grant DMS-1344994 funded by the National Science Foundation.

% In a real thesis, this section would contain acknowledgments such
% as, ``This work was funded by National Science Foundation Grant
% Number AAA-00-00000 (Benjamin Franklin, Principal Investigator),''
% and ``I would like to thank John Doe for helping me proofread my
% thesis and Mary Roe for drawing my graphs.''

% The acknowledgments are included in the table of contents but do
% not have a chapter number.  To achieve that, we
% declare them to be a \verb"\pseudochapter" (which is defined only in \verb"uga.sty").

% I would like to thank John Carroll for first pointing out to me that
% Georgia needed --- but did not have --- a \LaTeX\ style sheet.
% Immediately I looked at the widely distributed Stanford, MIT, and
% University of Illinois style sheets and decided they would not do at
% all. And that's how I got into this.

% I would also like to thank Mark Maloof for helping me find some bugs in
% the original version.

% Zachary Hunter deserves special thanks for revising the UGA style
% file to work with the new version of \LaTeX\ (2e) as well as the
% previous version (2.09).

% The revisions in
% Version 3.0 of \verb"uga.sty" are
% largely the work of Isidor Ruderfer.


% \pseudochapter{Preface}

% If your thesis has a preface, this is where it goes.
% A preface is not an introduction, and most theses do not need them.
